## Midterm project for Machine Learning Zoomcamp

Hello everyone, this is my midterm project for the 2023 cohort of the course [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp). This project will aim to train a machine learning model to predict prices of cars sold in Germany.

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wspirat/germany-used-cars-dataset-2023).
